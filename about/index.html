            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>A (currently) UK-based software engineer enjoys low-level programming, learning new things and staying awake at night solving problems. I got into programming thinking it's something I'd enjoy as a career; jokes on me - it became a hobby too.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>During a year-out between college and university, I taught myself to program in C. After enjoying it so much I went on to study on a Bachelor (Honours) degree in Computer Science at the University of the West of England (3/4 year sandwich course).</p>
            <p>In my 3yr at University I joined Intel for a 14-month internship. Here I was introduced to the world of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/what-is-the-iot/" title="Internet of Things">IoT</a>. This was a great experience, it introduced me to working on hardware and working on solutions all the way up to an end-user interface (web, android, etc). With a background in C, I naturally gravitated toward low-level software development and while able &amp; willing work web-dev, I find it challenging.</p>
            <p>In the middle of my final year at university I started work at a series-A startup company: AppSecTest, where I contribute write software for our solution to providing static analysis for security, legal and privacy compliance issues in Android applications (less boring than it sounds).</p>

            <h3>Ethos</h3>
            <p>Since graduating in Computer Science, I've found myself with enough free time and energy to spend on personal projects. These projects aren't limited to technology, but are really anything that I want to sink time into and result in something I'm happy with. I'm always using them to learn something new or take my own spin on something done before; they vary from small hobby-projects to absolute time-vampires. I've found these projects are <b>really</b> good for catharsis and keeping my personal growth &amp; passions from stagnating.</p>
            <p>Outside of software development and other projects, I love going to music gigs &amp; festivals, metal gigs are certainly the most fun, but I enjoy all sorts. Being a melennial based in Bristol (UK) for several years, I've come to enjoy craft-beer and visiting breweries. I grew up in forest-town and really enjoy wandering around woods, exploring new places and hiking. Gaming is how I wind-down when I get a minute, I've been a big PC gamer since I was young and getting old games to run is one of the things got me into technology in the first place.<p>
