            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>An English software engineer enjoys low-level programming, learning new things and staying awake at night solving problems. I either try my best, or not at all.<br />
            I got into programming thinking it's something I'd enjoy as a career; jokes on me - it became a hobby too.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>During a year-out between college and university, I taught myself to program in C.
            I went on to study on a Bachelor (Honours) degree in Computer Science at the University of the West of England for 4 years, with a 14-month internship at Intel in the middle; I graduated first-class in 2018.
            In the middle of my final year at university I started work at a series-A startup company: AppSecTest, where I helped write software to reverse-engineer mobile applications to check for security and legal compliance (less boring than it sounds).</p>

            <h3>Ethos</h3>
            <p>During my internship at Intel, I was introduced to the world of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/internet-of-things/what-is-the-iot/" title="Internet of Things">IoT</a>. This was a great experience, since I got to work on projects from embedded (microcontrollers) all the way up to end-user interfacing (web, android, etc) and everything in-between (data transport, databases, etc). Being a C-lover, I found the low-level software development most fun, and while able &amp; willing work web-dev, I don't find it challenging.</p>
            <p>Since graduating in Computer Science, I've found myself with enough free time and energy to spend on personal projects. These projects aren't limited to technology, but are really anything that I want to sink time into and result in something I'm happy with. I'm always using them to learn something new or take my own spin on something done before; they vary from small, silly hobby-projects to absolute time-vampires. I've found these projects are <b>really</b> good for catharsis and keeping personal growth &amp; passions from dying.</p>
            <p>Outside of software development and other projects, I love going to music gigs &amp; festivals, metal gigs are certainly the most fun, but I enjoy all sorts. Being a melennial based in Bristol (UK) for several years, I've become a <s>alcoholic.</s> fan of craft-beer (no beard though). I grew up in forest-town and really enjoy wandering around woods, exploring new places and long walks. Gaming is probably where my heart's at for off-time though, I've been a big PC-focused gamer since I was young and getting old games to run is what got me into technology in the first place, unfortunately I don't get as much time to game these days though.<p>

			<h3>alex-collins.dev</h3>
			<p>I built this site in about a week during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic#Prevention">2020 Covid-19 shutdown</a> that <i>most</i> countries experienced. It only uses HTML/CSS (written from scratch) since it's a really simple site, with only 3 pages.</p>
			<p>I've tried to make sure the site is nice and responsive. If you find any problems with it, here's my email: <a href="mailto:alexander-collins@outlook.com">alexander-collins@outlook.com</a></p>
			<p>The other thing I did during the shutdown was re-write my CV (job situation wasn't stable at the time). I did it in HTML/CSS because I got really sick of moving margin lines about after spending half a day starting it in a standard word processor. Personally I've always thought HTML/CSS is really underrated as a document writing tool - doing it like this has provided loads of benefits and flexibility.</p>
